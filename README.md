### Tic-tac-doh game

The game is a project for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class, as part of Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering at AGH UST.

The game opens in a browser tab after running the *game.py* file. The game is a classic tic-tac-toe against AI, but with a twist: with every move (both human's and AI's) there's a 20% chance that the move will be skipped.

The game itself and all the used classes and methods are implemented in the *utils.py* file.

In *experiments.ipynb* file there are experiments with different versions of Negamax algorithm, the game itself, and Expecti-minimax algorithm.
